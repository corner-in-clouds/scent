            <p>You might wondering, what does 'secrets about scents' even mean? Well I'm not here to reveal 
                business secrets like their marketing strategies or their fragrance recipe, the secret here refers 
                to my some of the experiences I've learned about using specific perfumes for specific occasions. <br><br>
                In other words, I'll be introducing some of my perfumes which I use in 
                different occations that requires me to appear with different personalities, if you are interested, follow me and keep reading ♡
            
            <br><br><br>
            The first scenario requires that I appear more approachable and friendly. 
            It frequently happens when I meet strangers or friends who aren't particularly close to me.
            <br><br>
            The second scenario pertains to more relaxed situations in which I may maintain the atmosphere 
            casual while also wearing perfume that I enjoy, and you guessed it, this scenario occurs when 
            I am with my close friends.
            <br><br>
            Finally, I am in my final year of university, therefore I need to prepare some perfume that will
             make me appear more professional and official; they are not necessarily my favourite because they 
             are typically quite powerful.       
             
             <br><br>
             Let's take a look at the perfumes! Hover your mouse over each of them for more info!
